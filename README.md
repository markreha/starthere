# Welcome to Professor Mark's GitHub Projects
I maintain many projects on GitHub that are mainly used by my students to support their courses at [Grand Canyon University](https://gcu.edu). 

The following are my GitHub Projects:
* [Cloud Workshop](https://github.com/markreha/cloudworkshop/) This repository contains the Cloud Workshop SDK, which has all of the documentation, tools, and sample template applications required to build a simple, scalable, Cloud based suite of IoT applications.
* [Cloud IoT Services](https://github.com/markreha/cloudservices/) This repository contains the example IoT Services Reference application that implements a number of REST API's that support the IoT Reporting application and IoT Device Raspberry Pi Sense HAT application, which in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud IoT Laravel Reporting Application](https://github.com/markreha/cloudapp/) - This repository contains the example IoT Laravel Reporting Reference application, which implements a simple IoT Reporting application that can be used to display the posted data from the IoT Device Raspberry Pi Sense HAT application. The IoT Reporting Reference application consumes a REST API published by the IoT Services Reference application. These applications in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud IoT Angular and React Reporting Applications](https://github.com/markreha/cloudapp2/) - This repository contains example IoT Angular and React Reporting Reference applications, which each implement a simple IoT Reporting application that can be used to display the posted data from the IoT Device Raspberry Pi Sense HAT application. The IoT Angular and React Reporting Reference applications each consumes a REST API published by the IoT Services Reference application. These applications in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud IoT Pi Application](https://github.com/markreha/cloudpi/) - This repository contains the example IoT Device Reference application implemented in a Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT. The IoT Device Reference application consumes a REST API published by the IoT Services Reference application. These applications in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud IoT Arduino Application](https://github.com/markreha/cloudpi/) - This repository contains the example IoT Device Reference application implemented in an Arduino Uno Wifi Rev2 and Lucky Shield. The IoT Device Reference application consumes a REST API published by the IoT Services Reference application. These applications in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud Research Project](https://github.com/markreha/cloudrdp/) - Can we design and build a fully functioning Private Cloud Platform using a cluster of Raspberry PIâ€™s using current Cloud Technologies? This research project will address that question.
* [NoSQL](https://github.com/markreha/nosql/) - This repository contains some example applications demonstrating the use of Firebase (both Realtime and Firestorm databases) and MongoDB Atlas (requires an account setup at mongo.com).
* [Play Spring App in the Cloud](https://github.com/markreha/playspring/) - A simple Java Spring application that can be used for testing in various Cloud Platforms like Azure and Heroku. This repository also has detailed notes on how to deploy this application to AWS, Azure, Heroku, and Google Cloud platforms.
* [Play Spring Boot App in the Cloud](https://github.com/markreha/playspringboot/) - A simple Java Spring Boot application that can be used for testing in various Cloud Platforms like Azure and Heroku. This repository also has detailed notes on how to deploy this application to AWS, Azure, Heroku, and Google Cloud platforms.
* [Play PHP Laravel App in the Cloud](https://github.com/markreha/playlaravel/) - A simple PHP Laravel application that can be used for testing in various Cloud Platforms like Azure and Heroku. This repository also has detailed notes on how to deploy this application to AWS, Azure, Heroku, and Google Cloud platforms.
* [Play Angular in the Cloud](https://github.com/markreha/playangular/) - A simple Angular application that can be used for testing in various Cloud Platforms like Azure and Heroku. This repository also has detailed notes on how to deploy this application to AWS, Azure, Heroku, and Google Cloud platforms.
* [Play React in the Cloud](https://github.com/markreha/playreact/) - A simple React application that can be used for testing in various Cloud Platforms like Azure and Heroku. This repository also has detailed notes on how to deploy this application to AWS, Azure, Heroku, and Google Cloud platforms.
