# Welcome to Professor Mark's GitHub Repositories
I maintain many projects on GitHub that I use mainly for use by students in their classes.
The following is a summary of my repositories:
* [Cloud Workshop](https://github.com/markreha/cloudworkshop/) This repository contains the Cloud Workshop SDK, which has all of the documentation, tools, and sample template applications required to build a simple, scalable, Cloud based suite of IoT applications.
* [Cloud Services](https://github.com/markreha/cloudservices/) This repository contains the example IoT Services Reference application that implements a number of REST API's that support the IoT Reporting application and IoT Device Raspberry Pi Sense HAT application, which in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud Application](https://github.com/markreha/cloudapp/) - This repository contains the example IoT Reporting Reference application, which implements a simple IoT Reporting application that can be used to display the posted data from the IoT Device Raspberry Pi Sense HAT application. The IoT Reporting Reference application consumes a REST API published by the IoT Services Reference application. These applications in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud Pi Application](https://github.com/markreha/cloudpi/) - This repository contains the example IoT Device Reference application implemented in a Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT. The IoT Device Reference application consumes a REST API published by the IoT Services Reference application. These applications in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud Arduino Application](https://github.com/markreha/cloudpi/) - This repository contains the example IoT Device Reference application implemented in an Arduino Uno Wifi Rev2 and Lucky Shield. The IoT Device Reference application consumes a REST API published by the IoT Services Reference application. These applications in combination demonstrate a simple, scalable, Cloud based IoT application.
* [Cloud Research Project](https://github.com/markreha/cloudrdp/) - Can we design and build a fully functioning Private Cloud Platform using a cluster of Raspberry PIâ€™s using current Cloud Technologies? This research project will address that question.
* [NoSQL](https://github.com/markreha/nosql/) - This repository contains some example applications demonstrating the use of Firebase (both Realtime and Firestorm databases) and remote MongoDB (requires an account setup at mongo.com).
* [Play Spring App in the Cloud](https://github.com/markreha/playspring/) - Simple Java Spring application that can be used for testing in various Cloud Platforms like Azure and Heroku.
* [Play PHP Laravel App in the Cloud](https://github.com/markreha/playlaravel/) - Simple PHP Laravel application that can be used for testing in various Cloud Platforms like Azure and Heroku.
